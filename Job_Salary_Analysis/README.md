# Job Salary Analysis

This project looks at job posting data with salary estimates and explores how pay changes across the U.S.

## What I Did
- Cleaned up the raw dataset (removed junk columns, fixed salary text like "$53K-$91K").
- Created new columns for min, max, and average salary.
- Pulled out states from the job location and grouped them into regions (South, Midwest, Northeast, West, West Coast).
- Made charts to show salary differences by region and by state.

## What I Found
- West Coast and Northeast jobs had the highest average salaries.
- The South and West showed lower salaries overall.

## Skills Shown
- Data cleaning with **Pandas**
- Basic text parsing with **Regex**
- Visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project was done in Python as part of my Master’s in Applied Data Science. 
It’s meant to show how I approach cleaning messy data and making it easy to understand with visuals.
