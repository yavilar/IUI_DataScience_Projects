# Coffee Dataset Analysis

This project looks at a dataset of coffee reviews with details like country of origin, farm information, altitude, processing methods, and quality scores.  
The goal was to explore what factors might influence coffee quality and to practice data cleaning and visualization in Python.

---

## What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the dataset in Jupyter/Colab.
- Looked at how **altitude** and **processing methods** affect overall quality scores.
- Compared average ratings across **countries of origin**.
- Built charts to make patterns easier to see.

---

## What I Found
- Coffees grown at **higher altitudes** often had higher total cup scores.
- **Washed processing methods** tended to score better on flavor and balance than some other methods.
- Countries had unique profiles — for example, some stood out in acidity while others were higher in sweetness.

---

## Skills Shown
- Data wrangling with **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Interpreting results and communicating them simply

This project is part of my Master’s in Applied Data Science at Indiana University.  
It shows my ability to take a messy dataset, clean it up, and find meaningful insights through Python analysis and visualization.
